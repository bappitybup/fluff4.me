tags/hint/main: fluff4.me has two kinds of tags.
tags/hint/global: {#B:Global tags} are chosen from a predefined list, meant for primary categorisation.\nThe first eight will always be displayed with your work. Any others will display only on the full work page.
tags/hint/custom: {#B:Custom tags} are custom text â€” whatever you want. Useful as stand-ins for missing global tags, or to better describe specifics.\nThese {#I:only} display on the full work page.
